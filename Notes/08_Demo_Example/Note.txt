-> to create github action what you can do is you can go to github repo and create .github/workflow
-> but what people normally do is go to repo /action and create a new workflow
-> GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax to define the workflow. Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file in your code repository, in a directory named .github/workflows.

*) Example 1:
    -> You can create an example workflow in your repository that automatically triggers a series of commands whenever code is pushed. In this workflow, GitHub Actions checks out the pushed code, installs the bats testing framework, and runs a basic command to output the bats version: bats -v.
    -> './.github/workflows/example-2.yaml'

*) Demo Example 2:
    -> for this example we will chose 'simple workflow'
    -> if you want to add some other action workflow the just search in github marketplace and copy the code and paste inside the workflow
