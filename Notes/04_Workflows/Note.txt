*) Workflows:
    -> https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#workflows
    -> specify the operation that what you want to achieve  
    -> Workflows are like pipelines
    -> Codify useful, customized process
    -> .yaml syntax
    -> .github/workflows
    -> Action run in VMs (Linux, Win, Mac)
        -> Or Docker on Linux VMs
    -> Log streaming & artifacts
    -> Secret store with each repository or organization
    -> Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory in a repository.
    -> a repository can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks. For example, you can have one workflow to build and test pull requests, another workflow to deploy your application every time a release is created, and still another workflow that adds a label every time someone opens a new issue.

*) Workflow files glue together existing actions in sequence
    -> Listen for particular events
    -> Then run per-existing actions
    -> Or shell scripts

*) How GitHub Actions automate these workflow?
    -> when something happens In or To your repository
        -> Like some events: PR created, contr.joined, other apps, Issue Created, PR merged
    -> automatic Actions are executed in response
    SO,
        Step 1: Listen to Event:
            -> PR created, PR merged, other apps, Issue created etc..
        Step 2: Trigger Workflow
            -> Workflow: 
                -> Sort (action)
                -> Label (action)
                -> Assign it (action)
                -> Comment (action)

*) CI/CD with Github Action
    -> most common workflow for you repository
    -> Lets Take example:
        -> given me an environment:
            -> with Node and Docker available
            -> with version of specify
            -> simply connect to a target and deploy
    

*) EX:
    -> build:
        runs-on :${{ matrix.os }}
        strategy:
            matrix:
                node-version:[8.x, 10.x, 12.x]
                os: [macos-latest, windows-latest, ubuntu-18.04]

    -> Here build will executed nine times, by it will build for macos for all 3 node version and windows for all 3 node version and so on

*) Starter Workflows:
    -> GitHub Provided starter workflows
    -> Pre configured for specific languages and frameworks 
    -> Suggested workflows based on languages and framework create you own workflows
