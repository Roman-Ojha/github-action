*) CI/CD Demo:
     here what we will do is we will:
    Step 1 : create a Java App with Gradle
    Step 2 : build Docker Images
    Step 3 : push to private repo


*) Steps:
     -> so first we will create a java app with Gradle
          -> https://github.com/Roman-Ojha/Test-Github-Action
     -> After that we will go to the Repo action and we will chose 'Java with Gradle' template
     -> After that we will going to take that java artifact file and we will going to build docker image out of it
     -> and we will deploy to docker hub private repo
          -> to deploy into docker repo first create the repo in docker hub


*)Where does this code run?
     -> manage by GiHub (BUT you can also host you own!)
     -> Each job in a workflow runs in a fresh virtual environment
